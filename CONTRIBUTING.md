## Code Style

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some modifications:

- **Line Length**: 100 characters maximum
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports, group by standard/third-party/local
- **Naming**: 
  - Functions and variables: `snake_case`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Private attributes: `_leading_underscore`

### Type Hints

Use type hints for all public functions and class methods:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Union

async def process_research_results(
    results: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
    quality_threshold: float = 0.8
) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Process research results with quality filtering."""
    pass
```

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def analyze_research_quality(results: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
    """Analyze the quality of research results.
    
    Args:
        results: Dictionary containing research findings and metadata.
        
    Returns:
        Quality score between 0.0 and 1.0.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If results format is invalid.
    """
    pass
```

## Testing

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest open_deep_research_strands/tests/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=open_deep_research_strands open_deep_research_strands/tests/

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest open_deep_research_strands/tests/test_agents.py
python -m pytest open_deep_research_strands/tests/test_integration.py
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Test Example

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock
from open_deep_research_strands.src.agents.supervisor_agent import SupervisorAgent

class TestSupervisorAgent:
    @pytest.fixture
    async def supervisor(self):
        """Create a supervisor agent for testing."""
        return SupervisorAgent()
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_execute_control_loop_success(self, supervisor):
        """Test successful execution of control loop."""
        # Arrange
        query = "Test research query"
        
        # Act
        result = await supervisor.execute_control_loop(query)
        
        # Assert
        assert result is not None
        assert "report" in result
```
