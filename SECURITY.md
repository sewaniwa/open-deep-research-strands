## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Open Deep Research Strands seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Open a Public Issue

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report Privately

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to us privately:

- **Email**: Send details to `security@[your-domain].com` (replace with actual email)
- **Subject Line**: Include "SECURITY" and a brief description
- **PGP Key**: [Optional - provide if available]

### 3. Include Details

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Type of Issue**: Buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.
- **Location**: File paths, URLs, or specific components affected
- **Impact**: How an attacker might exploit this vulnerability
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code snippets or screenshots if applicable

### 4. Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed about our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

## Security Measures

### API Key Protection

- **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- **Encryption**: API keys are encrypted when stored persistently
- **Access Control**: Limited access to API keys based on agent roles
- **Rotation**: Support for API key rotation without service interruption

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

- **Message Integrity**: All A2A messages include integrity checks
- **Session Isolation**: Research sessions are isolated from each other
- **Authentication**: Agents authenticate with the supervisor before communication
- **Audit Trail**: All agent communications are logged for security analysis

### Data Protection

- **Local Memory**: Research data is stored securely in local memory systems
- **Temporary Files**: Automatically cleaned up after research sessions
- **Sensitive Data**: Automatic detection and masking of sensitive information
- **Access Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all data access attempts

### Input Validation

- **Query Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Injection Prevention**: Protection against prompt injection attacks
- **Content Filtering**: Automatic filtering of malicious content
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks

### Cloud Security (Bedrock AgentCore)

- **IAM Integration**: Fine-grained access control using AWS IAM
- **VPC Isolation**: Network isolation in virtual private clouds
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II and other enterprise compliance standards

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**
   - Keep API keys confidential
   - Use environment variables for API key storage
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies

2. **Configuration**
   - Review configuration settings before deployment
   - Use strong authentication methods
   - Enable audit logging
   - Regularly update dependencies

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Monitor network traffic
   - Use VPNs for remote access

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize all outputs

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Review third-party libraries
   - Monitor for vulnerabilities

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests in CI/CD
   - Perform regular penetration testing
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Validate security controls

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Local Development**: Default configuration uses mock tools for security
2. **API Rate Limits**: Respect third-party API rate limits to prevent blocking
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage to prevent DoS through resource exhaustion
4. **Log Sensitivity**: Be cautious about logging sensitive research data

### Upcoming Security Features

1. **Enhanced Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for agent communications
2. **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Verification for all agent interactions
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: ML-based anomaly detection
4. **Compliance**: Additional compliance certifications

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions and documented in:

- **CHANGELOG.md**: All security-related changes
- **GitHub Releases**: Security advisories and fixes
- **Security Notifications**: Email notifications for critical issues

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

1. **Credit Researchers**: Acknowledge security researchers who report issues responsibly
2. **Coordinate Disclosure**: Work with you on disclosure timing
3. **Public Recognition**: Credit you in our security advisories (if desired)
4. **Bug Bounty**: [Future consideration for bug bounty programs]
