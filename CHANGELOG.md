## Migration Notes

### From Original Open Deep Research

This project represents a complete reimplementation of the Open Deep Research system using the Strands Agents framework. Key differences:

1. **Framework**: LangGraph → Strands Agents
2. **Architecture**: Monolithic → Multi-Agent with A2A communication
3. **Deployment**: Local only → Cloud-native with local development support
4. **Quality Control**: Basic → Multi-dimensional evaluation with gap analysis
5. **Scalability**: Limited → Production-ready with enterprise features

### Breaking Changes

As this is an initial implementation, breaking changes will be documented here as the project evolves.
